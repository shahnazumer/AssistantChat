Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, 
was a theoretical physicist who revolutionized the understanding of space, time, and gravity.
 His contributions to science, particularly his development of the theory of relativity, 
 quantum mechanics, and other fundamental aspects of physics, have made him one of the most 
 celebrated and influential scientists in history. Albert Einstein's early life was marked by 
 academic curiosity and an independent spirit. He attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, 
 where he excelled in mathematics and physics. However, his rebellious nature and dissatisfaction 
 with the rigid education system led him to leave school early. In 1895, Einstein moved to 
 Switzerland and enrolled in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. He pursued a
  diploma to become a teacher in mathematics and physics. Despite facing challenges in finding 
  employment after graduation, he eventually secured a position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern 
  in 1903. The year 1905, often referred to as Einstein's "Annus Mirabilis" or Miracle Year, was a 
  turning point in his career. During this period, he published four groundbreaking papers. 
  These papers addressed the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, 
  and mass-energy equivalence, laying the foundation for much of modern physics. In 1905, 
  Einstein introduced the special theory of relativity, challenging classical notions of space 
  and time. He later expanded this theory into the general theory of relativity, presented in 1915,
   which incorporated the force of gravity and provided a new understanding of how massive objects 
   influence the fabric of spacetime. Throughout his career, Einstein continued to contribute to 
   physics, but his attempts to create a unified field theory—combining electromagnetism and 
   gravity—proved elusive and ultimately unsuccessful. His resistance to the probabilistic 
 nature of quantum mechanics led to famous debates with Niels Bohr. Einstein's personal 
 life included several significant milestones. He married Mileva Marić in 1903, and they had two sons. 
 The couple divorced in 1919. In 1917, Einstein married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal. He became a 
 Swiss citizen in 1901, but in 1914, he moved to Berlin and later regained German citizenship in 1917. 
 Fleeing the rise of the Nazi regime, Einstein immigrated to the United States in 1933, eventually
  becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940.
